    _ Just at the moment when Congress had given their sanction to the Act of Commutation, intelligence arrived that the provisional Articles of Peace were signed; but the arrival of the Definitive Treaty being delayed beyond the general Expectation, and it being found necessary to diminish the public Expenditures, Congress thought proper to pass the following Resolution:

    _ Upon the Promulgation of this Resolution the subsequent Address was presented to the Commander in Chief.
